# CS-135-Final-Project



Quantum physics has changed our lives. Quantum computing and quantum communication would impact many sectors, including biotechnology, chemistry industry, energy, finance, security, etc. The race is underway. Investments to the quantum research and technology from governments, research institutions, companies all around the world increasing rapidly, and this leads to a rapid growth of the quantum computing market. 
With the development of the quantum technology, we see a growth in the quantum computing market. The global Quantum Computing Market size was USD 392.5 million in 2020. The market is expected to grow from USD 486.1 million in 2021 to USD 3,180.9 million in 2028, at a
CAGR of 30.8% 


Prediction of the quantum computing market size will in turn show the trend the global quantum technology competition. Thus we want to use machine learning technology to predict stock prices of leading quantum computing companies. 


This project seeks to utilize Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model, to predict stock prices. We use Keras to build a LSTM model to predict stock prices with historical opening, closing prices and trading volume, and visualize and compare both the predicted price values over time. We also compared the result of linear regression with LSTM.
